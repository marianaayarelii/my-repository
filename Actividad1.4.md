The following program randomly generates an integer greater than or equal to 0 and less than 100. 
The program then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user guesses the number correctly, the program outputs an appropriate message. 
Otherwise, the program checks whether the guessed number is less than the random number. If the guessed number is less than the random the 
number generated by the program, the program outputs the message, ‘‘Your guess is lower than the number’’; otherwise, the program outputs the 
message, ‘‘Your guess is higher than the number’’. The program then prompts the user to enter another number. The user is prompted to guess the 
random number until the user enters the correct number.
The program uses the method random of the class Math to generate a random number.
